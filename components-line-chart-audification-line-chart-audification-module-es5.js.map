used to shift all frequencies of a signal by a fixed amount.\n * The amount can be changed at audio rate and the effect is applied in real time.\n * The frequency shifting is implemented with a technique called single side band modulation using a ring modulator.\n * Note: Contrary to pitch shifting, all frequencies are shifted by the same amount,\n * destroying the harmonic relationship between them. This leads to the classic ring modulator timbre distortion.\n * The algorithm will produces some aliasing towards the high end, especially if your source material\n * contains a lot of high frequencies. Unfortunatelly the webaudio API does not support resampling\n * buffers in real time, so it is not possible to fix it properly. Depending on the use case it might\n * be an option to low pass filter your input before frequency shifting it to get ride of the aliasing.\n * You can find a very detailed description of the algorithm here: https://larzeitlin.github.io/RMFS/\n *\n * @example\n * const input = new Tone.Oscillator(230, \"sawtooth\").start();\n * const shift = new Tone.FrequencyShifter(42).toDestination();\n
